# HOW TO USE THE DRAGGABLECONTAINER
# its state is not persisted
# it should just hold the widget and let it move around, nothing else

# New Widget
# add ANY type of widget to the current section

# Display Widget
# show it visually
# probably be adding it to a draggablecontainer and showing it
# widgets should have a default and extensible menu? maybe attach that here
# this is called when widget is first added, and when loading a notebook
