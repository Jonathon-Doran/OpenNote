## Getting Started

### Downloading and Using
Simply find an appropriate release for your operating system under the "Releases" section. Once downloaded, run the OpenNote executable and the program will start.

Basic Usage:
* Right click on "Notebook Pages" in the left nav to add more top-level pages.
* Right click on any other page to add child pages to it.
* Right click on any of the current page's sections to add more or rename/delete it.
* Left click on the frame (the large white space under the sections) to add a new textbox, then begin typing.
* Right click on the frame to add a screensnip, table, paste, or add a custom widget.
* Right click on a widget to delete, copy, or paste it. This will also show widget-specific actions.
* Change the text under the "File" option in the menu bar to rename the notebook.
* Click the "File" button in the menu bar to Save or Load notebooks.

### Development

Simply clone the repo locally, install all required pip packages from the requirements.txt, then the project can be run from main.py.
See docs\ for documentation on how to implement custom widgets, and how the program works at a high level.
